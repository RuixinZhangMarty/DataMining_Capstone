In this task, you will work on mining this data set to discover knowledge about cuisines. In the Yelp data set, businesses are tagged with categories. For example, the category "restaurant" identifies all the restaurants. Specific restaurants are also tagged with cuisines (e.g., "Indian" or "Italian"). This provides an opportunity to aggregate all the information about a particular cuisine and obtain an enriched representation of a cuisine using, for example, review text for all the restaurants of a particular cuisine. Such a representation can then be exploited to assess the similarity between two cuisines, which further enables clustering of cuisines.

The goal of this task is to mine the data set to construct a cuisine map to visually understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities. The cuisine map can help users understand what cuisines are available and their relations, which allows for the discovery of new cuisines, thus facilitating exploration of unfamiliar cuisines.
