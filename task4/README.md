In this task, you will create a visualization showing a ranking of the dishes for a Yelp cuisine of your choice. You may use the dish list we have provided, the list based on your annotations from Task 3 (or a subset of that list), or any other list for other cuisines. You might find it more interesting to work on a cuisine for which you can recognize many dishes than one with only a few dish names that you recognize.

There are many ways to approach this task; the main challenge will be how to create the ranking. You can devise your own method or use other methods you have learned in the Text Retrieval MOOC. The simplest approach can be to simply count how many times a dish is mentioned in all the reviews of restaurants of a particular cuisine, but you are encouraged to explore how to improve over this simple approach, e.g., by considering ratings of reviews or even sentiment of specific sentences that mention a dish. Even if you just try this simple approach, you may still need to consider options of counting dish mentions based on the number of reviews vs. the number of restaurants, so keep this question in mind: What do you think is the best way of ranking dishes for a cuisine? This is an open research question, but your exploration may help us better understand it.
