In this task, you are going to predict whether a set of restaurants will pass the public health inspection tests given the corresponding Yelp text reviews along with some additional information such as the locations and cuisines offered in these restaurants. Making a prediction about an unobserved attribute using data mining techniques represents a wide range of important applications of data mining. Through working on this task, you will gain direct experience with such an application. Due to the flexibility of using as many indicators for prediction as possible, this would also give you an opportunity to potentially combine many different algorithms you have learned from the courses in the Data Mining Specialization to solve a real world problem and experiment with different methods to understand whatâ€™s the most effective way of solving the problem.
